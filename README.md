I've decided to stop working on this. I'd recommend using [lama](https://github.com/fnuecke/lama) instead.

# Mnemonicle
<sub>*(Mnemonic + Monocle)*</sub>

## Purpose
Mnemonicle is a library for use with [CC: Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked)'s [turtles](https://tweaked.cc/module/turtle.html)
for tracking the turtle's positioning data.
